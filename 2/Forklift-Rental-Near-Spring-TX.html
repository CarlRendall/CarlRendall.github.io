Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
<p>Some reach trucks come with a tilt mechanism in the cab to help the driver gain a better view of the operation.

Rear steering makes it difficult to stop a forklift quickly or swerve and still maintain control.
