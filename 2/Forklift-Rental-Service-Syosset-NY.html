If you're working outdoors, a gas forklift may make sense, but the introduction of the electric forklift has fundamentally changed warehouse usage.</p>

<p>Depending on your needs, you may find that a pallet jack is the best fit for your warehouse or product. These trucks like most of our products come up with the option of customization. Wrap orders before loading on trucks. In North America, reach trucks are typically stand up trucks. If the operator is riding in the order picking truck, they wear a specially designed safety harness to prevent falls.</p>
<p>What you need to do: Take a practical test where the forklift is driven around a suitable course and the operator will be required to move and stack various loads, the test will also include one to one verbal questioning.
