<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Available for a majority of popular trucks including the 1500 Silverado and the Ram 2500, Fabtech makes sure your truck gets lifted the right way without taking any shortcuts. With lift heights of up to 8.5 meters and load capacities from 1.2 to 3 tons, the Toyota 7FBRE series, 8FBRE series and BT Reflex series offers truck models suitable for block stacking, drive-in racking, and long load handling.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
