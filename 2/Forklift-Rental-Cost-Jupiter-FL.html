<h2>Fork Lifting Machine Jupiter</h2>
<p>Many rough terrain forklifts come with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive options. And one of the biggest barriers to making your warehouse work for you is the forklifts you have at your disposal. Use: Most commonly used forklift in the U.S. Primarily used indoors in warehouse type operations, good for use on smooth surfaces only. Overall Height Raised = The maximum extended height of the top of the load backrest or fork carriage of a completely extended mast.</p>
<p>If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself. The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine. Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>
<p>Our fleet of forklifts are from well-known manufacturers like Komatsu, Genie, Toyota, and Lull. Having rust free suspension components when we go to install a lift, makes for a smooth transition from stock to lifted.

Some SP Series models feature a 36-volt battery, which enables common batteries and chargers to be used across your lift truck fleet.
