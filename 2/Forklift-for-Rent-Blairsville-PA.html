Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components.

In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks.

<p>Safety features of this forklift truck include a high-visibility overhead guard, an emergency power disconnect switch, electric horn, and an anti-static ground strap. Manual pallet jacks have existed since at least 1918. Heavy loads and the shifting center-of-gravity can tip a forklift over if it goes too fast.
