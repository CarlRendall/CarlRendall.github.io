Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
<p>Not only is the distance between the frame and body widened, but the leaf springs are recreated to actually lift the entire suspension. We are one leading and largest supplier of Hydraulic Pallet Truck in North India.
