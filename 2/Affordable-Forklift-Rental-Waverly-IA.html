<h3>Forklift Truck Attachments Waverly IA</h3>
<p>In addition to forklifts, BigRentz has lifts, trucks, and construction equipment available. Moreover, the demand picks up in the new energy forklift market to which more and more entrants have accessed. Avoid additional charges for any damages made or caused by the wrong use of the rental equipment under your care and custody. Do not tow or push railway cars or trucks with a forklift.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>We'll customize any of our stock vehicles to your specifications, courtesy of The Lift Shop You pick the the truck you want from our lot, then pick your lift, wheels and tires and we'll build your dream truck. Turret truck pickers allow access to all levels of warehouse shelving, making it ideal for larger operations that use case picking operations. If you leave a forklift unattended, lower the forks to the ground.</p>
