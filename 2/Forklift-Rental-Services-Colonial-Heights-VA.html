The correct capacity will narrow your used forklift for sale search down to a couple of models. Smaller in size when compared to pneumatic tire forklift of equal capacity.

<h2>Fork Truck Colonial Heights</h2>
<p>Reach Truck = A truck equipped with a pantograph-type reach mechanism that allows the forks to extend out past the supporting outriggers. Class V forklifts are rider fork trucks, with cabs and seated controls, internal combustion engines, and pneumatic tires.
