Top-notch customer service and trustworthy equipmentâ€”that's why Atlas is one of the leading Toyota forklift dealers in the Chicago, IL area.

<p>With FLC's training, they'll learn how to properly and safely drive both regular and three-wheel counterbalance lifts, maneuver their way through tight spaces, properly handle and travel with heavy loads and avoid collisions, falling objects and other types of accidents.
