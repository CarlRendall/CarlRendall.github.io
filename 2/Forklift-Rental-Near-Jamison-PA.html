<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A telehandler forklift is also known as a telescopic forklift or a reach forklift.

There's no substitute for experience, but a forklift simulator can prepare you and reduce the chances of making a mistake on the job.
