We currently have over 100 Forklifts in our rental fleet as well as Skid-Steer Loaders and a Telehandler.

While the dealer insures the equipment, you'll want to make sure your company's insurance covers the operator, other people at your facility and the facility in the event of an injury or property damage when the rented forklift is in use.</p>
