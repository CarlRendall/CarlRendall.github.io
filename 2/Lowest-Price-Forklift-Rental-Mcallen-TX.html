Buying diesel forklifts are the other option and are easy to refuel.</p>

Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>

For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
