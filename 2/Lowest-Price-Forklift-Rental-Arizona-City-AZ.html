This type of rough terrain forklift is vehicle-mounted and fitted with a telescopic boom lift, which allows this machine to pick up and transport loads at various distances and heights.</p>
<p>The greater suspension travel allows the vehicle to navigate rough, undulating surfaces with less of a chance of the body striking the ground or any object you're trying to drive over. A couple of other comments about Komatsu are important for all forklifts. Forklifts have been lifting America's economy for over a century and we can now quantify our industry's economic contributions to the overall U.S. economy,‚Äù said Brett Wood , president and CEO of Toyota Material Handling North America and chairman of ITA.</p>

If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast.
