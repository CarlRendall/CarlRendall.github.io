You can find Counterbalance Forklift Truck Driver jobs in Knowsley Industrial Park, Kirkby Ind Est, Kirkby Industrial Estate and Kirkby (L32). Welcome to Dave Arbogast Lifted Trucks, located in Troy, Ohio. Three-wheeled counterbalance forklifts are mainly used in warehouses and loading docks where there isn't much room for maneuvering or turning.</p>

Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
