<p>Typically, these types of vehicles are known as forklifts or lift trucks. When you buy a pallet truck then you will come across many varieties in the market. It is common for indoor electric forklifts to use cushion tires. Rough terrain forklifts are essential material handling equipment on many worksites. A different type of forklift is to be used. Other key features include an intuitive multi-function control handle, patented open view mast, low step height, ductile iron baselegs and an exclusive suspension system for superior load stability.</p>
<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg).

As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
