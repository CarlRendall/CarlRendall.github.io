A electric forklift (also called lift truck, jitney, fork truck, fork hoist, and forklift truck) is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials over short distances.</p>
<p>Sit-down forklifts are also more accessible to a wider pool of forklift operators for that reason. Some of these can also save you on the purchase of unnecessary equipment by converting a rough terrain forklift to a number of other heavy industrial machines. Lift Capacity: 6000 lbs. First, forklifts can be classified according to the type of engine. Renting a forklift requires almost as much forethought as buying one.</p>

<p>United Rentals was founded in 1997 and is the largest equipment rental company in the world. Items such as computers, drums, corrugated boxes, plastic bottles, furniture and beverages are examples of products which are stacked onto pallets and moved by reach trucks.
