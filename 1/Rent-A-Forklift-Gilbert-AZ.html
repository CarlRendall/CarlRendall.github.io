<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck. Fuel cell forklifts also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.</p>

Sitting forklift controls mirror automobile controls with a steering wheel and hydraulic levers for the forklift mast.

As a result, with the adoption of advanced technology, there are substantial market opportunities, owing to the efforts of the manufacturers that are indulged in manufacturing forklift trucks that are technologically driven.</p>
<p>The Industrial Truck Association has placed powered industrial trucks into 7 classes. Most kits include a standard or heavy duty compressor, a controller and all the hardware that you need to install the compressor onto your vehicle. This means that they are perfect for transporting heavy loads across rugged terrain, with some models handling up to 3 tonnes per load.</p>

Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
