<p>All personnel required to operate a Industrial Counterbalance Forklift Truck should complete this training and testing. It is also backed with priority support from our nationwide team of field service forklift technicians. While it can't reach difficult angles the way that a telehandler can, it is capable of lifting payloads much higher off the ground than a warehouse forklift and heavier loads.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>Built to tackle any type of environment, the K2 package includes 6-inch suspension lift-kit, custom wheels and tires. 35 inches or bigger is the common size range for determining whether or not a truck is truly a lifted truck.
