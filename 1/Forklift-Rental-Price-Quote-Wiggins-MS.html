Even if you specified you would need the rental for a specific amount of time, i.e. 2 days, it is the renters responsibility to make sure the equipment is returned.</p>
<p>Our fleet of forklifts are from well-known manufacturers like Komatsu, Genie, Toyota, and Lull. Having rust free suspension components when we go to install a lift, makes for a smooth transition from stock to lifted.

For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
