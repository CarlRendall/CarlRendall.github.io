<p>A slight variation on the walkie rider pallet jack, the operator stands in the middle of a center-controlled rider pallet jack. Counterbalanced forklifts have been a source of storage and handling systems, where they perform loading, stacking, distribution and horizontal transport functions. Renting is ideal for short-term jobs or situations where equipment needs may change quickly.</p>
