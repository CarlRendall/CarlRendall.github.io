<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck. Fuel cell forklifts also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.</p>

<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns.
