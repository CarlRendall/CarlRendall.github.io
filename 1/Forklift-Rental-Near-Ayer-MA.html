<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Available for a majority of popular trucks including the 1500 Silverado and the Ram 2500, Fabtech makes sure your truck gets lifted the right way without taking any shortcuts. With lift heights of up to 8.5 meters and load capacities from 1.2 to 3 tons, the Toyota 7FBRE series, 8FBRE series and BT Reflex series offers truck models suitable for block stacking, drive-in racking, and long load handling.</p>
<p>This added weight increases the lifting capacity of the unit to between 2,200 and 4,000 lb. The load center is the distance from the forks to the center of gravity of the load. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Built to lift boats in and out of tall storage racks while coping with the corrosive nature of seawater, marina forklifts are over-sized lifts with long, rubber-coated forks.</p>
<h2>Classes Of Forklift Trucks Ayer </h2>

Rental provides the means to obtain the latest technology improving operator satisfaction, WH&S and overall efficiencies. For a more controlled ride that keeps your tires touching the ground beneath you for continuous contact, you need Jeep shocks to replace your old, worn out ones and put you back in control in the driver's seat.</p>
<p>Leading Manufacturer of terrain pallet truck, hydraulic hand pallet truck, 5 t hand pallet truck, ss hand pallet truck, scissor pallet and 2.5 t hand pallet truck from Ahmedabad. We can help your business identify your unique needs and help narrow your search for the right forklift or equipment to fit those needs, all while keeping you within your budget. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment.</p>
<p>Also, this rental service is available to us in many types at pocket-friendly rates. To operate an order-picking forklift truck you need an LO high risk work licence. Since washing a lifted truck also involves washing tires (and pretty massive ones sometimes), I would recommend using a handheld tire brush like the one pictured above for rubber sidewalls. There are different models of forklifts, and there are various forklift features that might not be the same with every model.</p>
<h2>Electric Pallet Jack Ayer</h2>

<p>On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved. As a result, drivers will feel sleek and cool behind the wheel of some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. The SP Series 4-wheel platform stock picker is a heavy-duty stand-up lift truck used in areas where loads are bulky or extra long, such as furniture or department store warehouses.</p>
