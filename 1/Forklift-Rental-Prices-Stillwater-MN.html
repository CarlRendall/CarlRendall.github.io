<h2>Pallet Truck Stillwater</h2>
<p>This workshop is designed for participants who have little or no working knowledge of operating a counterbalance forklift. Do not steer pallet jacks onto uneven surfaces and avoid steep inclines. Also known as a large capacity forklift, the industrial forklift is essential for a warehouse with heavier loads. Class I lift trucks are extremely versatile and can be used in many areas of a production operation from the loading dock to the storage facility.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're in need of new , used , or rental equipment, our team will work with you to ensure you find exactly what you need to complete the job. Weight capacity may range from 3,000 to 55,000 lbs., meaning there are Class V forklifts well-suited to handling everything from single pallets to loaded 40-foot containers. You can learn to operate the Construction Lift (Class 7 ), or add Warehouse Lift (Class 1,4,5) , Reach Lift (Class 2), Order Picker (Class 2) or Walkie-Rider (Class 3) lifts for an additional charge.</p>
<p>This means the lift truck doesn't have to face the shelvesâ€”it can drive straight while still picking up loads to the side. Powered by a lithium-ion battery, this electric pallet truck offers up to 3 hours of use. Depending on the quality of your shocks, you'll likely enjoy more control of your vehicle and higher ground clearance as well. We will focus on how to maintain your forklift's stability and handling, as well as how to lift loads properly.</p>

Order pickers feature an elevating platform that brings the operator to the level of the stock, similar to a cherry picker. The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads.</p>
