<p>If you are new to buying a forklift, carefully consider what type of forklift you need. Our expertise lies in a consultative approach to providing the best value-for-money forklift solution available to suit your needs. Double-deep trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks, and they are ideal for warehouses where a lot of pallet loads are stored in each bay.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
