The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>All types of dockboards should be designed and maintained so the end edges will have a substantial contact with the dock (or loading platform) and the carrier to prevent the dockboard from rocking of sliding. The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>
<p>Dillon Toyota Lift has everything from lift trucks, rough terrain forklifts, sweepers, scrubbers, and more. Due to its sideways operation, side load forklifts can easily drive up alongside racks and load and unload without having to turn.
