The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install.

<p>Imagine the devastation of crashing with a semi-truck - that's the kind of damage you can expect from a lifted vehicle. Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
