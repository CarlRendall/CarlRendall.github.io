<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>RT forklifts are ideal for smaller jobsites, due to it's lower cost and maneuverability. Constructed to fit in narrow aisle spaces, a forklift maneuvers around crowded warehouses with ease. Therefore, no matter what the specific characteristics are of the individual pallet jack, it is still one of the most versatile and usable pieces of moving equipment for any business to have readily available for everyday use.</p>

Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents.

<p>Delta Electronics launched a 30kW wireless battery charging system, which can charge a 600Ahr-48V battery in just 60 minutes, making it ideal for large and complex vehicles, such as scissor lifts, forklifts, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and more.
