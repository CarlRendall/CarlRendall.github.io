Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>

As the fork lift trucks are usually quite expensive, many industry enterprises choose to buy used forklifts on industrial auctions, which reduces the cost of the process they implement.</p>
