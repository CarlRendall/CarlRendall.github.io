It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches.

<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame. I'm talking about the unGodly big, oversized tires, mudflaps, etc type of trucks that look completely and utterly ridiculous.
