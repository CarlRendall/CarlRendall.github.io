<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds.

The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop. They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>
