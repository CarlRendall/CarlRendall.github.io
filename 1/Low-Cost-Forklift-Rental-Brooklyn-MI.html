In addition, the use of a powered industrial truck in a location for which that type of powered industrial truck is not designated for use, for example due to a flammable atmosphere, can result in a fire or explosion. This means that Linde reach trucks can maneuver safely and quickly, even in confined spaces and handling conditions in warehouses.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
